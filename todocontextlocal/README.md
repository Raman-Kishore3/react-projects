# Todo List Website

using React for single page application and also Tailwind CSS to beautify it
the todo list where items can be added and can be edited when the edit button is clicked. When the item is completed we cannot modify the name of the item in the list

all the items in the todo list are stored in the localStorage

using context API where contexts are made to make all the components get the context of the data and functions

we have 2 components - TodoForm and TodoItem
